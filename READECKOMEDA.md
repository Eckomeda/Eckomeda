16 years of failure in the flesh, founded in Lima, Peru on 02/12/2007. (DD/MM/YYYY)
Doesn't care about LIBERAL pronouns. (Any are fine ❤️)
I'm an avid fan of many games/shows, I love Halloween and Christmas because I am holidaypilled.
I like the idea of creating things unique to myself, but I lack motivation.
Y sí, yo se español.
Ok follow me on X (formerly Twitter) dot com, @eckomeda2, or add me on Discord @eckomedical thanks, bye, love you!
